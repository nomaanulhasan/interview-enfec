# interview-enfec

This repository is a result of one of my interview tasks. The project revolves around a placeholder API, specifically ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users```. I have implemented this project using `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, and `Vite`. Notably, I utilized `react-query` for the first time to effectively manage data through API calls.

Being aware of the growing popularity of `react-query` within the developer community, I saw this small project as the perfect opportunity to showcase my ability to quickly adapt and learn new technologies. Additionally, incorporating `Vite` into the project allowed me to leverage its fast and efficient development environment.

By combining `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Vite`, and `react-query`, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing modern tools and frameworks to build performant and scalable web applications.
